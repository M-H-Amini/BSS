# BSS
A module I've written for the so-called Blind Source Separation

In this project, I've mixed 3 sources which are voices of Gilbert Strang, my favorite Linear Algebra professor, Andrew Ng, My first machine learning professor (by his coursera course), Heidarali Talebi, my lovely digital control professor.

After that, I've used Independent Components Analysis (ICA) to separate their voices and the results are awesome.
